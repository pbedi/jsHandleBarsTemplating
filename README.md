jsHandleBarsTemplating
======================

 A sample based on VideoTutorialWatch session 20 &amp; 22 - which used Twitter query at that time, but now Twitter has stopped offering it without authentication. I have used ColdFusion as back end to supply and filter data

A CFC has been added to do JSON calls, you can use different server to do this call.

A table script has been added in to create a table and populate with dummy data.

You need to add images for thumbnails - if you want to show them, I would suggest you should do that.

I have used a Bootstrap and jQuery UI library provided by:

Chapterwise index files for 13,14,15,23

Chapter 24 uses php file to read and write content

Chapter 25, 26 uses php and MySQL sample DB(Sakila) to read data and display list and details of actors:

Here is the DB you need to download and install:

Chap 28 has been converted to use local db created in chap 20/22 as Twitter has stopped opening search API
