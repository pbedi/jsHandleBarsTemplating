jsHandleBarsTemplating
======================

 A sample based on VideoTutorialWatch session 20 &amp; 22 - which used Twitter query at that time, but now Twitter has stopped offering it without authentication. I have used ColdFusion as back end to supply and filter data

A CFC has been added to do JSON calls, you can use different server to do this call.

A table script has been added in to create a table and populate with dummy data.

You need to add images for thumbnails - if you want to show them, I would suggest you should do that.

I have used a Bootstrap and jQuery UI library provided by:
